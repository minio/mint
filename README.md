# Mint
Collection of tests to detect resource leaks, gauge performance problems and overall quality of Minio server.

# Design.
- Mint is designed to enable easy running of series of tests built using a wide variety of tools.
- To make the task easier Mint is built as a single docker container with all the necessary dependencies and tools installed.


# How to run.
  The project will be published in Docker hub after further more testing. Till then the docker image has to be build locally and run.

  ```sh
  $ git clone https://github.com/minio/mint.git 
  ```

- Build and Run

  ```sh
  $ cd mint
  $ docker build -t minio/mint:alpha .
  $ docker run -e ENDPOINT=play.minio.io:9000 -e ACCESS_KEY=Q3AM3UQ867SPQQA43P2F  -e SECRET_KEY=zuf+tfteSlswRu7BJ86wekitnifILbZam1KYY3TG -e ENABLE_HTTPS=1  mint:alpha
  ```

# Options.
